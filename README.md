## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from 2021 to help newcomers - like myself - to Airbnb make good investement decisions by answer these three primary questions:
1) Which areas do Airbnb owners typically target - what areas are those in Seattle? 
  - this was done by looking at the most areas with the most Airbnb rentals.
2) What type of properties do Airbnb owners typically purchase?
3) How much could we charge per area, on average, and what were the drivers for the price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook that is used to answer theses questions and 3 supporting files with the data:
The main notebook is called: airbnb_notebook.ipynb

The data files are:
listings.csv
calender.csv
reviews.csv
